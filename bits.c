/*
 * Assignment: Bit Twiddling
 * Class: CSC 252 Spring 2016
 *
 * TA: Wolf Honore (whonore@u.rochester.edu)
 *
 * Instructions:
 * Fill in the following functions and turn this file in.
 *
 * Restrictions:
 * You MAY NOT change any of the function defintions.
 * You MAY NOT define any global variables, macros, or other functions.
 * You MAY NOT use any operations not listed in the function's description.
 * You MAY NOT use any control statements (if, loops, switch, function calls).
 * You MAY NOT use any constants outside of an unsigned byte (0 - 255 (0xFF) inclusive).
 * You MAY NOT cast any variables.
 * You MAY NOT use data types other than ints.
 *
 * You MAY define local variables.
 * You MAY use the assignment versions of allowed operators (+=, |=, etc).
 * You MAY use more than one operator per line.
 *
 * Your results will be tested on a machine that:
 * Uses 2s complement, 32-bit representations of integers.
 * Performs right shifts arithmetically.
 * Has unpredictable behavior when shifting an integer by more than the word size.
 *
 * If any of the instructions or function descriptions are unclear please contact the TA (see
 * above).
